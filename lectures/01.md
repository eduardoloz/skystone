## What is Git?
Git is a version control system. It keeps track of changes to code. Code is stored on a central server and can be cloned onto your local remote computer. You can edit the code on your remote version and then update the code stored on the central server. 

Install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## What is GitHub?
Git needs a server to function. GitHub is the most popular of these servers.
  - Allows for management of who can edit your code.
  - Has a friendlier interface than your terminal if you feel lost.
  - Industry standard.

## How to Git?
### basic commands 
This will cover a few pretty essential git commands. More documentation can be found online. 
```
  git clone <repository-link> // this will make a local copy of all of the code that is located at the GitHub repository. 
                              // will create a folder in your current directory with the name of the repositry
                              // you can rename the folder by doing git clone <repository-link> <optional-folder-name-here>
  
  git pull                    // this command will be run when you are in the folder containing the local copy of the git repo
                              // will get the most recent version of the code that is on the GitHub server 
                              // it is generally a good idea to pull before you start a new coding session to avoid differences in code
                              
  git status                  // will show the current status of changes you made
                              // please run this before adding, committing, and pushing 
                              
  git add <filename>          // will add changes you have made to <filename> to the commit stage
                              // git add .  will add all files you have changed in your current folder  
  
  git checkout -- <filename>  // will remove the files you added from the commit stage
          
  git commit -m "<message>"   // commit the changes to the files you have added.
                              // make your message is meaningful so we know what you did
  
  git push                    // will update the code on the GitHub server with the changes you committed
```
