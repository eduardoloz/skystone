## Terminal basics
All of you have probably interacted with your File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac. You can view all of your folders, create new files, delete files, etc. 
All of this can be done in a terminal or command prompt.
```
  cd <folder-name>    // changes your current directory to the folder name
  cd ..               // changes your current directory to the parent directory 
  ls                  // view all the files in the current directory (on mac/linux)
  dir                 // view all the files in the current directory (on windows)
  mkdir <folder-name> // makes a new directory 
```
## What is Git?
Git is a version control system. It keeps track of changes to code. Code is stored on a central server and can be cloned onto your local remote computer. You can edit the code on your remote version and then update the code stored on the central server. 

Install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## What is GitHub?
Git needs a server to function. GitHub is the most popular of these servers.
  - Allows for management of who can edit your code.
  - Collaborative, open-source, without interfering with each other's own development.
  - Has a friendlier interface than your terminal if you feel lost.
  - Industry standard.
  
**note**: Go to your settings and attach your name to your accounts.

**note**: Upgrade your GitHub account [here](https://education.github.com/pack) with a pack from GitHub Education.

## How to Git?
### basic commands 
This will cover a few pretty essential git commands. More documentation can be found online. 
```
  git clone <repository-link> // this will make a local copy of all of the code that is located at the GitHub repository. 
                              // will create a folder in your current directory with the name of the repositry
                              // you can rename the folder by doing git clone <repository-link> <optional-folder-name-here>
  
  git pull                    // this command will be run when you are in the folder containing the local copy of the git repo
                              // will get the most recent version of the code that is on the GitHub server 
                              // it is generally a good idea to pull before you start a new coding session to avoid differences in code
                              
  git status                  // will show the current status of changes you made
                              // please run this before adding, committing, and pushing 
                              
  git add <filename>          // will add changes you have made to <filename> to the commit stage
                              // git add .  will add all files you have changed in your current folder  
  
  git checkout -- <filename>  // will remove the files you added from the commit stage
          
  git commit -m "<message>"   // commit the changes to the files you have added.
                              // make your message is meaningful so we know what you did
  
  git push                    // will update the code on the GitHub server with the changes you committed
```

### what are branches?
Say that you have a stable version of code currently on GitHub's master branch (the master branch is the default branch). You want to test out an experimental feature but you don't want to mess with the stable version of the code. You can create a new branch to develop the experimental feature. Changes on this branch are not reflected in the master branch until a merge occurs. 

### more commands 
```
  git branch                    // check which branch you are currently on
  
  git branch <new-branch-name>  // create a new branch 
 
  git checkout <branch-name>    // go to branch <branch-name>
  
  git merge <branch-name>       // will merge the version of the code from <branch-name> into the branch you are currently on
                                // if someone else has been working on the current branch, there may be merging conflicts between the two code versions. 
                                // Sometimes GitHub will automatically resolve these conflicts but other times you will have to do so manually. 
```

### what are pull requests?
Pull requests are a GitHub feature that automates merging between branches if there are no conflicts. Allows for people to review code  

## What is Android Studio?
Android Studio is typically used for mobile app development for Android devices. However, we are using it just to deploy our code onto a phone with the FIRST Robot Controller app. There are a lot of features in Android Studio but we don't use most of them. Android Studio does allow you to use git without using the terminal but try to stick to using the terminal for better practices. Important features are the play button and the debug button on the upper right corner which allow you to deploy working code to the phone.

## IMPORTANT
- Make a github account
- Install git (and verify that git commands work in terminal)
- Install Android Studio
- Clone the skystone repo

Once this is done, your environment is set up and you're ready to go.
